`Where the North wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river, all is found`,

`In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned`,

`Yes, she will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?`,

`Where the North wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
When all is lost, then all is found`,
