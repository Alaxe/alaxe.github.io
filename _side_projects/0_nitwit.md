A programming language that uses [prefix notation] for amusement
purposes: for example, `a = (b + c) * d` looks like `= a * + b c d`.
Nitwit is imperative, strongly typed, and uses reference-counting garbage
collection.
The Nitwit compiler produces C code, which can then be compiled to an
executable.
