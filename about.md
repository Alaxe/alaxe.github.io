Hi, I'm Alexander Crustev, a geek interested in computer programming. While I
am not a professional software developer, I began coding at school in 2011 and
it quickly became my main hobby.

A huge chunk of what I do is solving algroithmic problems, either taking part in
informatics competitions or solving tasks from past ones. I have participated in
both national (in Bulgaria) and international competitions, the biggest one
being the [IOI][ioi]. Sometimes I enter online competitions, most often
in [Codeforces][cf-profile].

I also enjoy working on bigger projects and while I could go into detail here I
would suggest checking out the [projects page][projects] or my
[Github profile][gh-profile].

I blog about anything that interests me, you have to see for yourself if it is
right for you. To get in touch you can email me at [aleks.tcr@gmail.com][mail].
