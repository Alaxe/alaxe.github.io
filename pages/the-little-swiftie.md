I was rereading _The Little Prince_ (I'm having difficulties with a flower), and when I got to this illustration, I immediately knew what was coming next.
I didn't want the prince to go away.
I caught myself unwilling to turn the page.
Instead,

> Don't read the last page

from Taylor Swift's [New Year's Day] started playing in my head, which got me thinking---can I interpret _New Year's Day_ as a song about the relationship between the pilot and the little prince?

Sure, I can tell that it's gonna be a long road, but let's give it a go!

* * *

The little prince leaves earth exactly one year after his arrival;
so, _New Year's Day_ must be describing the immediate aftermath of this departure.
From the pilot's perspective.

Perhaps, the desert sand is glittering in the morning sun ("there's glitter on the floor after the party");
perhaps, having fixed the engine, the pilot is now overflying the garden of lovely, but empty roses ("girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby").

> Please don't ever become a stranger  
> Whose laugh I can recognize anywhere

The little prince's laugh is precisely what he gave to the pilot as a present!
And, that's what the pilot will remember him by:

> Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you  
> And I will hold on to you

* * *

But what if the prince was just a mirage?
What if he was nothing more but a manifestation of the pilot's childhood memories, brought forth at the thought he was about to die?
Then, _New Year's Day_ would be exploring the pilot's relationship with his inner child.

> But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared  
> And you're turning away

Isn't it precisely fear---perhaps in the form of insecurity or shame---that has pushed the king, the vain man, the drunkard, and the businessman to lose their inner children and turn into serious grown-ups?

> I'll be here if you're the toast of the town, babe  
> Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

My inner child definitely needs me, as its pilot, to be there for it:
to help it navigate our insecurities and to provide it with a safe space to play around and be curious.

Plus, it can only be a small child that's "crawling home," right?
