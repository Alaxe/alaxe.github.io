# Hello There!

I'm a first-year PhD student doing computer architecture research with Professor [Daniel Sanchez][daniel] at MIT.
Besides that, I currently enjoy listening to [podcasts], [tinkering][linux] with Linux, and, yes, obsessing over
<span title="And though I can't recall your face&#010;I still got love for you">Taylor Swift</span>.
