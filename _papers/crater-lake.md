CraterLake is the state of the art hardware accelerator for FHE,
with speedups of 5,000Ã— over a CPU on a broad range of FHE applications.
It builds upon F1's functional units, while contributing a novel architecture
that significantly reduces on- and off-chip data movement.

I came up with the way computation is distributed across the chip (Sec. 4),
designed the on-chip network (Sec. 5.3), and designed the KeySwitch hint
generator (Sec. 5.2).
