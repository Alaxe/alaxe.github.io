CraterLake is the state-of-the-art hardware accelerator for FHE, providing
speedups of 5,000Ã— over CPU on a broad range of applications.
Building upon F1's functional units, CraterLake introduces a novel architecture
that significantly reduces on- and off-chip data movement.

I came up with the way computation is distributed across the chip (Sec. 4),
designed the on-chip network (Sec. 5.3), and designed the KeySwitch hint
generator (Sec. 5.2).
