CraterLake is the state of the art hardware accelerator for computation on
encrypted data.
It achieves speedups of XXX over a CPU and 10x over F1.

I came up with the way computation is distributed across the chip (Sec ??),
designed the on-chip network, and designed the KeySwitchHint generation unit.
