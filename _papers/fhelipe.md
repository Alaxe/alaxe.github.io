Fhelipe is an FHE compiler exposing an easy-to-use tensor programming interface.
Fhelipe simplifies programming by abstracting data layouts and noise management, while achieving great performance via two key contributions: a novel bit-permutation tensor layout representation and a novel bootstrap placement algorithm.
Fhelipe is the first compiler to match the performance of large hand-optimized FHE applications, outperforming prior compilers by gmean 18.5Ã—.

I designed Fhelipe's layout representation, helped design all algorithms in the compiler, and implemented the compiler frontend.
