F1 was our initial proposal for an FHE accelerator.
F1 achieves speedups of ?? over CPU through use of novel functional units, but
struggles with large FHE applications due to its hard to scale on-chip network
and use of suboptimal algorithms (these addressed by CraterLake).

I came up with the design of the first SRAM-only, fully-pipelined transpose
unit.
This is used in the fully-pipelined implementations of FFTs and automorphisms.
