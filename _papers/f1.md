F1 was our initial proposal for an FHE accelerator.
F1 employs novel high-throughput functional units, but its on-chip network
doesn't scale to larger applications.
As a result F1 is about 5,000× faster than a CPU on small applications (similar
to CraterLake), but only 400× faster on larger ones, (11× slower than CraterLake).

I designed the first SRAM-only, fully-pipelined transpose unit (Sec. 5.1), a
crucial component of F1's novel FFT and automorphism units.
